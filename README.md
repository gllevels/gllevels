# üí´ About Me:
Recently, I finished an intensive 3 month bootcamp, where I learned various skills in SQL, Tableau, Python, Pandas, data visualization and descriptive statistics. <br>I look forward to starting my career as a Data Analyst and utilize these skills, combined with my passion for logical and analytical thinking. <br>During my experiences in the hotel and real estate industry, I could acquire important skills like a well-founded understanding of customer needs, strong attention to detail and the ability to work in a fast-paced environment. <br>I am now at a position, where I want to combine all my experiences and skills, to help a company make important decisions, by analyzing data and solving complex problems. <br>If you are looking for a logical and analytical thinker who is always willing to go the extra mile, I would love to introduce myself!
